# Misconception Lab

EurekaDev 2026 Coding Track prototype.

## Problem
Most study software treats wrong answers as a single category. Two students can miss the same question for completely different reasons: selecting the wrong concept, applying the right concept incorrectly, missing a constraint, or guessing with poor confidence calibration.

## Solution
Misconception Lab turns each error into evidence for a lightweight causal profile. It then chooses a next test designed to distinguish the most likely failure mode rather than simply giving more random practice.

## Current prototype
- runs entirely in the browser
- records topic, suspected cause, and confidence
- accumulates evidence weights
- visualizes a misconception graph
- recommends a discriminating next test
- persists state in localStorage

## Run
Open index.html in a browser.

## Competition status
Built locally for EurekaDev 2026. Nothing has been published or submitted externally.

## AI Assistance Disclosure
This project was developed during EurekaDev 2026 with AI-assisted coding and writing support from ChatGPT. The project concept, competition entry, testing decisions, and final submission are owned and directed by Zaky. AI assistance was used to accelerate implementation, debugging, documentation, and test generation. The repository intentionally includes deterministic tests and a transparent inference core so judges can inspect the implemented logic.

## Competition
Built during the EurekaDev 2026 hackathon window for the Coding Track, Computer Science + AI (Technology) category.
